1. Can it be that a cell starts the experiment in S phase? Are such cycles that begin in stationary phase and continue through the medium switch relevant? If yes, need to rethink calculation of cell cycles length.
2. Cell filtering - do cells that never undergo a complete cell cycle matter?
3. How should the data be saved? For now [here](file:///home/tauras/cell-size-analysis/20250819_PM021_PM024_Stat_to_Glc_s02_acdc_output_cells_WT.csv)
